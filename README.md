# LeetCode-Practice [link](https://leetcode.com/)

Welcome to my LeetCode Practice repository! Here, I solve various coding challenges from the LeetCode platform using Python. Each problem is solved step by step, with explanations and examples provided.

## üöÄ Motivation

My motivation is to learn Python and improve my problem-solving skills by solving algorithmic problems.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- Each exercise is stored in a **separate Jupyter Notebook** file.
- For every problem:
  - The problem statement is described.
  - Examples from LeetCode are provided.
  - I explain the approach I used to solve it.
  - A **link to the LeetCode problem** is included for reference.

## üß† Problem Solving Approach

- Problems are solved based on the most logical approach for each specific case.
- I use various data structures like arrays, dictionaries, etc., depending on the problem requirements.

Feel free to explore the solutions and contribute!
