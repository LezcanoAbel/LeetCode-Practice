    "# LeetCode Problem 3146: Permutation Difference between Two Strings\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-difference-between-two-strings/description/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given two strings `s` and `t` such that:\n",
    "- Every character occurs at most once in `s`\n",
    "- `t` is a permutation of `s`\n",
    "\n",
    "The **permutation difference** between `s` and `t` is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the indices of each character in `s` and the same character in `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to return the permutation difference between `s` and `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**  \n",
    "`s = \"abc\"`  \n",
    "`t = \"bac\"`  \n",
    "**Output:**  \n",
    "`2`  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The permutation difference is calculated as follows:\n",
    "- For character 'a': |0 - 1| = 1\n",
    "- For character 'b': |1 - 0| = 1\n",
    "- For character 'c': |2 - 2| = 0  \n",
    "\n",
    "Total permutation difference: 1 + 1 + 0 = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**  \n",
    "`s = \"abcde\"`  \n",
    "`t = \"edbac\"`  \n",
    "**Output:**  \n",
    "`12`  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The permutation difference is calculated as follows:\n",
    "- For character 'a': |0 - 3| = 3\n",
    "- For character 'b': |1 - 2| = 1\n",
    "- For character 'c': |2 - 4| = 2\n",
    "- For character 'd': |3 - 1| = 2\n",
    "- For character 'e': |4 - 0| = 4  \n",
    "\n",
    "Total permutation difference: 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 12\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 ‚â§ s.length ‚â§ 26\n",
    "- Each character occurs at most once in `s`\n",
    "- `t` is a permutation of `s`\n",
    "- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach to Solve the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a dictionary to map each character in `s` to its index\n",
    "2. Iterate over each character in `t` and calculate the absolute difference between the index of the character in `s` and `t`\n",
    "3. Sum up all the absolute differences to get the permutation difference\n",
    "4. Return the total sum as the result\n",
